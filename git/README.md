# Git Configuration

Git provides a myriad of configuration options that help developers optimize their environments and boost productivity. However, working with different Git cloud providers, such as [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com), or across various operating systems can create challenges where a single Git configuration file becomes impractical. To tackle this problem, Git offers `include` and `includeIf` directives to import platform-specific settings and personal information from other sources.

> The `include` and `includeIf` sections allow you to include config directives from another source. These sections behave identically, with the exception that `includeIf` sections may be ignored if their condition does not evaluate to true; see "Conditional includes" below.

This document provides information about the strategy used to organize my Git configuration files.

## Configuration Overview

### Naming Convention

As with other naming guidelines, the goal when naming configuration files is creating sufficient clarity for the user to immediately know what the content of the file is likely to be. The following template specifies the general rule used:

```text
(config|.gitconfig).(<Platform>|<Git Provider>)[.(personal|work)]
```

The following are examples:

`config.windows` `.gitconfig.github.personal`

### Including Personal Configurations

To include a personal configuration file, use the following directive:

```text
[include]
    path = ./config.personal
```

This line includes a personal configuration file, allowing you to separate sensitive information, such as email address, signing key, or any other information that could be harmful if exposed, from the main configuration.

### Conditional Inclusion

To conditionally include configurations based on specific directories, use the following directive:

```text
[includeIf "gitdir/i:%(prefix)//mnt/c/"]
    path = %(prefix)//mnt/c/appdata/roaming/git/config.wsl
```

The `gitdir` condition ensures that the specified configuration is only loaded when working within certain directories, enhancing security and flexibility. The `/i` part configures the matching to be case-insensitive, and by ending the path with `/`, it automatically adds `/**`, thus matching all subdirectories.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, Git reads configuration options from [two user-wide configs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_configuration): `.gitconfig` in the home directory, and `$HOME/.config/git/config` unless `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config` is set. Since neither of these are Windows-native directories, [Git for Windows now looks for Git/config in the AppData directory](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/pull/5030), unless `$HOME/.config/git/config` exists. Worth note that this feature isn't enable by default, the presence of the file in one of the specified directories as a cue that the user wants to use this feature, therefore, we need to create it manually.

## Security Considerations

When managing Git configurations, be mindful of security implications related to storing sensitive information:

- **Avoid Direct Storage**: Do not versioning passwords or tokens stored in your configuration files.
- **Use Secure Authentication**: Utilize tools like [Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/git-ecosystem/git-credential-manager) or SSH keys for authentication.
- **Regular Audits**: Regularly audit your configurations for any sensitive data that may have been inadvertently included. Sensitive data can include API tokens, private keys, or personal information.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your Git configurations across different environments while maintaining security and organization.
