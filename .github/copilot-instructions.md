# dotfiles - GitHub Copilot Instructions

This document provides guidance for GitHub Copilot when generating code for this project. Follow these guidelines to ensure that generated
code aligns with the project's coding standards and architectural principles.

## Commit

- Avoid undescriptive one-liner commit messages
- The first line should be short, 50 characters or less, and express intention
- Write the commit message in present imperative tense
- The second line is blank
- Next line optionally defines a summary of changes done and should focus on _Why_, not the _What_.
- Wrap it to 76 columns per line.
- Use emojis when possible to convey the type of change made. For example:
  - ✨ for new features
  - 🐛 for bug fixes
  - 📝 for documentation changes
  - 🔧 for configuration changes
  - 🚀 for performance improvements
