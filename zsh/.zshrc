# This file is for interactive shell configurations such as setopt and unsetopt commands,
# load shell modules, set history options, change the prompt, set up zle and completion.
# It can also set any variables that are only used in the interactive shell (e.g. $LS_COLORS).

# Sets the history file path and options.
# The values chosen here are the recommended value to have a substantial history without overly impacting performance.
