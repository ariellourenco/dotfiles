# Windows

This folder contains all the necessary files and steps to customize a new Windows 11 machine to be able to start building apps ðŸš€. This is done using a combination of [Windows Package Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/winget/) (WinGet) [Configuration File](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/package-manager/configuration/) (*configuration.dsc.yaml*) that will work with the WinGet command line interface (`winget configure --file [path: configuration.dsc.yaml]`) and manual tasks.

When run, the `configuration.dsc.yaml` file will install the following list of applications:

* Git for Windows

The `configuration.dsc.yaml` file will also apply the following changes on the target machine:

* Enable [Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/developer-mode-features-and-debugging)
* Enable Dark Mode
* ~~Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux optional feature~~
* ~~Enable Virtual Machine Platform optional feature~~
* ~~Install [Ubuntu for WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/)~~
* Disable [User Account Control (UAC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/security/application-security/application-control/user-account-control/)
* Set up a [Dev Drive](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/dev-drive/) of 64Gb using a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) with a per-user directory path location to store the Dev Drive
* Configure packages cache location on Dev Drive

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The [PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/overview?view=dsc-2.0) that enable Windows optional features has been commented out due to an error with winget configuration calls to DSC resource. For further details, see: <https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/4264>.

## How do I use this folder? ðŸ¤”

To use this folder, simple follow the steps below.

1. Download the `configuration.dsc.yaml` file to your computer.
2. Open your Windows Start Menu, search and launch "*Windows Terminal*" as Administrator.
3. Type the following:

```powershell
winget configure --file [path: configuration.dsc.yaml]
```

### Microsoft Office 365

**Microsoft Office 365** requires its own subsection in this document. In earlier versions of **Microsoft Office**, users could customize the installation by selecting specific applications. In **Office 365**, this is no longer possible. The full Office suite of applications will be installed, whether it is an MSI installation from ISO or a Click-to-Run installation, and it is no longer possible to remove or add individual Office applications.

To achieve this custom installation behavior, Microsoft released the [Office Deployment Tool (ODT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/overview-office-deployment-tool) â€” a command-line tool that provides more control over an Office installation. With ODT, you can define which products and languages are installed, how those products should be updated, and whether or not to display the installation experience.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use the [configuration file](office/configuration-Office365-x64.xml) with ODT to customize an Office installation or modify an existing one:

1. Right-click **Windows PowerShell** or activate its context menu, and then select "*Run as administrator*"
2. Install the ODT by typing the following: `winget install --id=Microsoft.OfficeDeploymentTool -e`
    * The command above download and extract the ODT within the `C:\Program Files\OfficeDeploymentTool` directory
3. Download the `configuration-Office365-x64.xml` file to the ODT command-line tool folder
4. Navegate to the ODT folder and type the following: `setup.exe /configure configuration-Office365-x64.xml`

The final result will be a clean installation of Microsoft 365 Apps with only:

* Microsoft Excel
* Microsoft OneNote
* Microsoft PowerPoint
* Microsoft Word

You can [customize](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-apps/deploy/office-deployment-tool-configuration-options) this list by updating the `configuration-Office365-x64.xml` file with your required apps.

>[!NOTE]
> We're aiming to streamline our WinGet configuration by automating the Office 365 Apps installation as well as other features! Currently, this step requires manual intervention, which isn't ideal. If you have WinGet experience, we encourage you to submit a pull request adding this functionality. Help us make this happen! ðŸ¥‡
