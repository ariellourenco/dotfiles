It's been said of every console user:

> _"you are your dotfiles."_

This repository includes multiple configuration files that help me setting up a nice terminal experience across multiple environments. It contains everything needed to install my preferred setup on MacOS and Windows on their respectively default shells (bash, PowerShell, ZSH). Each component has its individual ```README.md``` file, which covers the instruction on how to get started.

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to try out these dotfiles then you should fork this repository, review the code, and remove anything that you do not want. These are my preferences and it might not suits your needs. Please proceed with caution.
